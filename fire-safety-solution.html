                            <p>The objective of environmental impact assessment is to offer information to
                                decision makers concerning matters that may be brought about as a result of
                                decisions relating to a new project, program, plan or policy. Environmental
                                impact assessment must realize decision-making based on the inputted
                                information including potentially important factors and it must be beneficial for
                                both the proponent and the citizens. Furthermore, environmental impact
                                assessment is a technique that presents in a systematic manner a technical
                                assessment of impacts on the environment that the project is likely to cause
                                and explains the significance of predicted impacts and as a result, it indicates
                                the scope for modification or mitigation. Finally it makes the concerned
                                ministries/agencies assess the potential results of the project before a
                                decision is given. Project developers and administrative agencies who have a
                                responsibility for environmental consideration can use environmental impact
                                assessment technique to improve the quality of both the project plan and
                                decision-making by identifying possible effects in the early stages. The
                                specific objections of the environmental impact assessment system are as
                                follows:

                            <h4 class="rev-right">What is Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA)?</h4>
                            <p>Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is a process of evaluating the likely environmental impacts of a proposed project or development, taking into account inter-related socio-economic, cultural and human-health impacts, both beneficial and adverse.</p>
                            <p>UNEP defines Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) as a tool used to identify the environmental, social and economic impacts of a project prior to decision-making. It aims to predict environmental impacts at an early stage in project planning and design, find ways and means to reduce adverse impacts, shape projects to suit the local environment and present the predictions and options to decision-makers. By using EIA both environmental and economic benefits can be achieved, such as reduced cost and time of project implementation and design, avoided treatment/clean-up costs and impacts of laws and regulations.</p>

                            <p>Lightning protection system (LPS); transfer the lightning current safely to the ground. This system includes air termination, down conductor and earth termination system which is also known as a lightning protection grounding system that intended to provide a low resistance path to dissipate high current into the soil.</p>
                            <h4 class="rev-left">What is LPS?</h4>
                            <p>A lightning protection system is designed to protect a structure from damage due to lightning strikes by intercepting such strikes and safely passing their extremely high currents to ground. A lightning protection system includes a network of air terminals, bonding conductors, and ground electrodes designed to provide a low impedance path to ground for potential strikes.</p>
                            <h2>Lightning Protection System (LPS)</h2>
                            <h4>Who Needs Protection?</h4>
                            <p>Thunderstorms occur virtually everywhere and that puts any building at risk. According to BNBC & NFPA lightning protection systems are a part of the structural design. Thousands of commercial and public facilities are designed to maximize protection of life and property. Risk factors including your location, frequency of thunderstorms, soil composition and building occupancy determine the need for a lightning protection system.</p>
                            <h4 class="rev-left">Thunderstorms Result</h4>
                            <p>On a building without lightning protection, those same millions of volts of electricity still have to get to the ground. Lightning will use your electrical wiring, your telephone or cable wiring, structural elements of your building, or anything else it can find as a “path to ground”. None of these building elements is designed to safely carry this amount of electricity. The result is a build-up of resistance, which leads to fire and explosive damage to your building.</p>
                            <h4 class="rev-left">How it Works ?</h4>
                            <p>A lightning protection system performs a simple but crucial task. Lightning contains millions of volts of electricity. When lightning strikes your building, your lightning protection system provides a specified, highly-efficient path on which the millions of volts of electricity can travel safely to the ground.</p>
                            <h4 class="rev-left">Protecting Your Homes</h4>
                            <p>Protecting your home is a matter of contacting a professional who is qualified to design and install a certified lightning protection system. A complete lightning protection system is typically made up of the following components:</p>

At the same time, they warn workers to always keep watching out for those hazards by giving required information and safety instructions. <br>
                                Safety signs and symbols do not only inform the presence of hazards, but also help create workers’ safety awareness.
